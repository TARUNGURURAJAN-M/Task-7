This project demonstrates how to use Python with SQLite, Pandas, and Matplotlib to extract and visualize simple sales data. It connects to a tiny SQLite database (sales_data.db), runs basic SQL queries to calculate total quantity sold and total revenue by product, and displays the results using print statements and a bar chart.

ðŸš€ Features:
SQLite database setup with sample sales data
SQL query for sales summary
Data visualization with Matplotlib

ðŸ›  Tools Used:
Python (sqlite3, pandas, matplotlib)
SQLite (built-in)
Jupyter Notebook or .py script
